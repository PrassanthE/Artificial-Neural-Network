# Artificial-Neural-Network(ANN)
Automated a 2d game using artificial neural netwroks(ANN)

HOW TO RUN THE GAME:

1. First, run the code Nesa_Game.py 
2. Train the ANN by using Training_model.py
3. Now run ANN_AutoPlay.py code to see the Artificial Neural Network's Magic

DESCRIPTION:

Nesa_Game.py:

The code NesaGame contains the normal 2d game where Vadivelu(Legendary Tamil Comedian) needs to dodge the hammers.(In loving memory of #Pray for Nesamani)
When the player plays the game the required data is collected and stored in a CSV file which can be used later to train the AI.
I have also included the original images which I used in the game. 

Training_Model.py:

This code contains Keras libraries and models which I have used. I also include the number of neurons and the hidden layers used to train this model.
In the last line, I am saving this model which can be used later to automate the game.

I have included 3 training models which I have trained under different scenarios(epagent1, epagent2, epagent3)

ANN_AutoPLay.py:

If the model is trained properly then the AI will play the game for eternity.
